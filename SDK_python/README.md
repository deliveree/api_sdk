## Getting Started
Please follow 3 steps bellow.

1 . Clone the repo from GitHub

2 . Import the SDK into your code
```shell
    >>> from sdk_python import SdkPython
    >>> deliveree_sdk = SdkPython()
```

3 . Check out the configurations under SDK_python/src/conf for each of 6 available APIs. Get your API keys and example data from duke@deliveree.com and update config files accordingly.


## Available APIs:
After getting API key and example data from duke@deliveree.com, you can start testing the integration with 6 APIS below. 
### 1. Get quote

    >>> SdkPython().get_quote(
            api_key,
            time_type,

            vehicle_type_id,
            packs,
            locations
        )
```

### 2. Get Vehicle Types

    >>> SdkPython().get_list_dlvr(api_key)
```

### 4. Get Booking by ID
```shell

    >>> SdkPython().create_dlvr(
            api_key,
            vehicle_type_id,
            note,
            time_type,
